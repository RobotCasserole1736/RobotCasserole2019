To Use:
Run the set_aws_env_vars.bat (available from Nick) which will set user env vars containing the AWS key and secret
Install boto3 using pip (python 3 must first be installed)
This script will upload any new csv files from the folder .\downloaded_logs to AWS
DO NOT UPLOAD the "set_aws_env_vars.bat" to the web (including through git) under any circumstances!!!
