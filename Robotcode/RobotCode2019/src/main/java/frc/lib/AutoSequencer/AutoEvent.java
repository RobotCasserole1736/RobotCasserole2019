/**
 * AutoEvent is the abstract class which all things put onto the robot autonomous timeline must
 * implement. For example, A path-planned motion profile is one type of event. Rotating in place,
 * closed loop around a gyro is another type of event. Raising an arm is another type of event. <br>
 * <br>
 * Events are fundamentally two types - parent events and child events. Parent events are the
 * primary ones run by the sequencer. Any event that is added directly to the sequencer is a parent
 * event. These events will be run in order, each one starting as soon as the previous one declares
 * it is finished. <br>
 * <br>
 * Child events are assigned to a parent event. While a parent event is running, each child event is
 * evaluated individually to see if it is triggered (needs to start running) or stopped (needs to
 * stop running). As soon as a child event reports it is triggered, at least once call to the child
 * event's update() method is guaranteed. The child event will no longer be run once it declares
 * itself as "done". <br>
 * <br>
 * All events on the timeline must implement the functions defined here. Constructor is for performing
 * all user-specific actions during sequencer setup. User update is the periodic update function
 * which the sequencer will call as long as the event is active. isDone() signals the sequencer this
 * event no longer needs to run, while isTriggered() is used for child events to signal they need to
 * be run. Calculation of triggered/done conditions shoudl be performed within those methods. Do not
 * rely upon update() to be called to evaluate those conditions. Finally, the forceStop method is
 * required to be implemented - ordinarily, the event should return the robot to a safe state before
 * declaring itself done. However, if the autonomous sequence is interrupted before the event has a
 * chance to finish naturally, this function will be called to shut down the event properly. This
 * means doing things like stopping motors or resetting counters, whatever floats your boat
 * (safely).
