/**
 * DESCRIPTION: <br>
 * PID Controller algorithm designed by FRC1736 Robot Casserole. The WPIlib PID library is pretty
 * darn good, but we had some things we wanted done differently. Therefore, we did it ourselves.
 * This is the Advanced flavor of our PID algorithms. We have no idea if it will actually be useful
 * for FRC purposes, but the concepts are not beyond what we believe an advanced FRC student could
 * understand. <br>
 * <br>
 * See the CasserolePID class documentation for more info on how different PID stuff should be
 * utilized. This class wrappers/extends that base PID class with more functionality. However, its
 * fundamental usage should be the same as the main class. <br>
 * <br>
 * There are number of new features added by the Advanced flavor. <br>
 * <br>
 * Gain Scheduling is a controls technique where the gains for a PID controller are modified at
 * runtime based on some variable.
 *
