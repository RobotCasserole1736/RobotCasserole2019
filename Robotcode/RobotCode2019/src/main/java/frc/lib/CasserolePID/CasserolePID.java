/**
 * DESCRIPTION: <br>
 * PID Controller algorithm designed by FRC1736 Robot Casserole. The WPIlib PID library is pretty
 * darn good, but we had some things we wanted done differently. Therefore, we did it ourselves.
 * <br>
 * This controller implements a "PIDFdFP2" controller, with a few selectable options. Execution runs
 * at 10ms (2x speed of *periodic() loops from FRC), this will be made adjustable in the future.
 * Output each loop is simply the sum of each term, with not memory of previous outputs (except in
 * the integral term). Output can be capped to a specific range, and the integral term can turn
 * itself off when the error is too big (prevents windup). More features to be added in the future!
 * <br>
 * TERMS IN CALCULATION:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Proportional</b> - The error, equal to "setpoint - actual", multiplied by a gain. The
 * simplest form of feedback, should push a system toward the setpoint.</li>
 * <li><b>Integral</b> - The integral of the error over time, multiplied by a gain. Helps with
 * correcting for small errors that exist over longer periods of time, when the P term alone is not
 * sufficient.</li>
 * <li><b>Derivative</b> - The derivative of the error, or of the actual value(user selects),
 * multiplied by a gain. Helps to rate-limit the P term's action to reduce overshoot and increase
 * stability (to a point).</li>
 * <li><b>Feed-Forward</b> - The setpoint, multiplied by a gain. Helps get the system to a zero
 * error state for systems where there is a linear relationship between setpoint and "ideal system"
 * control value (Think shooter wheel - more motor command means more speed. For a speed-based
 * setpoint, there is a linear relationship between control effort (motor command) and setpoint)
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Feed-Forward</b> - The setpoint's derivative, multiplied by a gain. Helps in scenarios
 * where when the setpoint changes, it's useful to give the system a single "knock". Think using a
 * motor to control to a certain angle - you'll need lots of effort when the setpoint first changes,
 * but ideally no effort once you've gotten to the right place.</li>
 * <li><b>Proportional Squared</b> - The error squared but with sign preserved, multiplied by a
 * gain. Helpful in non-linear systems, and when you can afford to be very aggressive when error is
 * large.</li>
 * </ul>
 * USAGE:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create new class as a super of this one</li>
 * <li>Override methods to set PID output and return feedback to the algorithm.</li>
 * <li>Call start() method to begin background execution of algorithm.</li>
 * </ol>
